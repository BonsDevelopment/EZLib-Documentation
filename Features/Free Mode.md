# Feature: Free Mode
## Requries: N/A

**__Description__**
Free Mode is a feature that you can enable within EZLib when your application is in a stage where you would like it to be free until it is stable. You do not want to have a seperate application laying around in the internet of your application being completely free. This allows you to disable all authentication measures, once it is disabled the user will be prompted with proper authentication.

**__Where can I find this feature?__**
*Assuming you have created an applicaiton already.*

You click `Edit Application` under the options of your application then click `Application Settings` and check `Free Mode`.
