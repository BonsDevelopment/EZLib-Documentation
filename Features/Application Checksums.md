# Feature: Checksums
## Requires: Premium/Premium Plus

**Description**

The checksum feature provides additional security for your application. The server will not accept a request without a valid checksum. Valid checksums can be added to your application via the website and are entirely server-sided. 

Checksums stop modified copies of your application from communicating with EZLib servers. This means the application will not be able to retrieve sensitive data like server variables.
