# Feature: Checksums
## Requries: Premium/Premium Plus

**__Description__**

Checksums is a server-sided anti-tamper. It will not accept any requests without a valid checksum from your application that have not been added to the verified checksums. This stops `cracked` applications from accessing EZLib.

**__Where can I find this feature?__**

*Assuming you have created an application already.*

You click `Edit Application` under the options of your application then click `Application Settings` and check `Force Checksums`. Head over back to your applications and click `Application Checksums` under the options of your application. Click `Create` on the page it has redirected you to and add a `Note` to remind you what version of checksum it is (to delete older ones/drop support for older versions) and uplaod your assembly.
