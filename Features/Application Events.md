# Application Events

**Description**

The events feature provides the developer a way of knowing triggered events in their application.

Events are powered by a user when they have initialized an application. If the application has `Application Events` enabled then the webhook will be sent a notification of triggered events. 

Please note that this feature is optional and is not required for your application to run.
